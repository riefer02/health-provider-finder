# Provider Matching Criteria Guide

## Overview

Our matching system is designed to connect Asian and Asian American patients with culturally competent healthcare providers who understand the unique mental health needs, cultural nuances, and intergenerational dynamics within Asian communities.

## Core Matching Criteria

### 1. Essential Requirements

- **Location Compatibility**: Providers must be available in the patient's requested location
- **Provider Availability**: Providers must have open capacity to accept new patients

### 2. Cultural and Identity Matching

#### Language Preferences

Examples:

- A first-generation Chinese immigrant seeking a Cantonese-speaking provider for precise emotional expression
- A Vietnamese family requesting a provider fluent in both Vietnamese and English to facilitate family therapy sessions
- A Korean American client preferring a bilingual provider who understands code-switching between Korean and English
- A Filipino patient seeking a Tagalog-speaking provider who understands regional dialects

#### Cultural and Ethnic Identity

Examples:

- A South Asian client seeking a provider who understands cultural expectations around academic achievement and career choices
- A Japanese American patient requesting a provider familiar with intergenerational trauma from internment camps
- An Asian adoptee looking for a provider experienced in Asian adoptee identity development
- A Chinese American client seeking support for navigating bamboo ceiling workplace challenges

#### Gender and Family Dynamics

Examples:

- A young Asian American woman seeking a female provider who understands cultural expectations around marriage and family
- An LGBTQ+ Asian individual seeking a provider experienced with coming out in traditional Asian families
- A multi-generational Asian family seeking family therapy with understanding of filial piety and hierarchical family structures

### 3. Specialization Matching

#### Areas of Concern

The system matches providers based on expertise in Asian-specific mental health areas:

- Immigration and acculturation stress
- Asian American identity development
- Intergenerational trauma and family dynamics
- Model minority pressure and perfectionism
- Cultural shame and face-saving concerns

#### Treatment Modalities

Examples of culturally-informed approaches:

- Family systems therapy incorporating Asian family values
- Somatic therapy addressing cultural trauma
- Narrative therapy exploring cultural identity
